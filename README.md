# E-Commerce Sales analysis
### Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed the demographic data of bike buyers, focusing on income and gender differences between those who purchase bikes and those who do not. Additionally, I examined the distance traveled by bike buyers and identified key age brackets. I also analyzed purchasing attitudes based on marital status, region, and occupation. 


### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Project Dataset.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Excel - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning

In the bike purchase project, I undertook a comprehensive data cleaning process to ensure the dataset was accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. Here are the key steps I followed:

- Data Inspection: Initially examined the dataset to identify any inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and outliers that could affect the analysis.
- Handling Missing Values by removing unnecessary columns and imputing missing values.
- Removed unnecessary columns: Eliminated columns that were not relevant to the analysis.
- Data Transformation:
  - Created new variables: Derived new variables where necessary, such as categorizing age groups or calculating total purchase amounts, to enrich the dataset and provide more insights.
  - Applied data validation rules: Implemented validation rules to ensure data integrity and prevent future input errors.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- On average, male adults purchase more bikes across all regions and occupations, regardless of marital status.
- Detailed insights into income levels and distances traveled by bike buyers.
- Analysis of age brackets revealed specific trends in bike purchasing behavior.

This comprehensive analysis provided valuable demographic insights, informing targeted marketing strategies and product positioning
