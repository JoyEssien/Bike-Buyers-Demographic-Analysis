# Bike-Buyers-Demographic-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the demographic data of bike buyers, focusing on income and gender differences between those who purchase bikes and those who do not. Additionally, I examined the distance traveled by bike buyers and identified key age brackets. I also analyzed purchasing attitudes based on marital status, region, and occupation.
